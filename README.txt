Di'el's Skill Tree Simulator for Blade & Soul
This is a skill tree simulator for all classes of Blade & Soul.
This was done possible by reading the source (using the view source button of a browser) of the official
Blade & Soul korean website. Most functions should work without an internet connection. Only some images 
are downloaded from other sites.



Disclaimer:

The following files (used for the skill tree itself) is made by ncsoft. 
Most of those are modified by me for translating, fixing bugs and optimizing webpage size.

data_skill-tooltip.js (split into separate files for each class)
data_skill-tooltip-attribute.js
training.min.js
training2.css
common.js (only used the functions relating to JSON)
category_data_XX.js
slot_data_XX.js
skill_data_XX.js


Some codes like jquerytools.js are codes I found floating in the internet.
Background images are taken by me or found on the bns kr screenshot forum.
Skill images are directly from the bns kr website.

If you are going to use, modify and/or host this project yourself, please give credit to where it belongs.

simplifier

- it's a tool I made to quickly optimize data_skill-tooltip-attribute.js and skill_data_XX.js by cutting unused lines of code
